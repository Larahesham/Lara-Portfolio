<div class="paragraph-1"><p>To take a good photograph, it is mainly based on the amount of light that is taken into the DSLR camera. Light in the camera language is known as the exposure
    To set the exposure in the best possible way, three main aspects should be balanced: aperture, shutter speed , and ISO. If an image is very bright and no details are shown, it is said to be over-exposed because it includes too much light. If the image is too dark then it is under exposed. This means that not enough light entered to the sensor
    Other than the option that is in the camera for the exposure, the other three camera controls play a very important role in balancing the light.</p></div>
<div class="sub-2"><h3>Apreture:</h3></div>
<div class="paragraph-2"><p>The aperture is how much light passes due to how opened or closed the lens is.A more opened lens creates more exposure making it brighter. A more closed lens creates less exposure making the image darker. This is known from specific controls in the DSLR. As the f/stop number increases it results in a more closed lens. As it decreases, it results in a more opened lens.</p></div>
<div class="sub-3"><h3>ISO:</h3></div>
<div class="paragraph-3"><p>Iso is important for the exposure because it also controls how bright or dark the image can be. It also plays around with how exposed the image will be like the aperture but the difference here is that the Iso could also affect the quality of the image.For instance, if the Iso is raised very high it will create noise in the image, which means that it will look grainy. That means that the lower the number of the Iso the better for a sharp and clear image. In addition to that, the Iso should be changed according to the time of the day; for instance, at the morning the lower it is the better and at night it should be higher but still oe should watch out for the quality of the image.
</p></div>
<div class="sub-4"><h3>Shutter Speed:</h3></div>
<div class="paragraph-4"><p>Similar to the aperture , that relates to how open or closed the lens is, the Shutter speed controls how long the lens is open or closed for the amount of light to enter.
    This will effect the exposure in a way. For instance, if the shutter speed increases that will mean that less light will pass in because it will close faster. If the opposite, meaning that the shutter speed decreases, more light will enter and the image will be more exposed to the light because it will slowly close the diaphragm.
